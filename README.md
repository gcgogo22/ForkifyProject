Forkify is a recipe finding web application which uses data from the Forkify API (https://forkify-api.herokuapp.com/v2). This app provided a search funciton that can be used as a guide to find cooking recipes among over 1 million. Beyond accessing recipes from different sources online, it also provides information on the number and amount of ingredients needed to build a specific dish according to the number of people to serve. Users can bookmark their favourite recipes, and they can also add their own recipes in the app.
